              Quantum Computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information exponentially faster than classical systems.  
              With the power of <em>superposition</em> and <em>entanglement</em>, quantum computers can tackle problems in cryptography, optimization, and simulation that are practically impossible for traditional machines.
